# Ambient Musical System
A musical system inspired by the works of Philip Glass.

A totally random system - each reload will yield a new musical experience.
No refresh will ever be the same.

On each load, a random reverb, instrument, notes  and note lengths are chosen to provide a unique ambient track.
