# Ambient Musical System
A musical system inspired by the works of Philip Glass.

## Description
On each load, a random instrument, musical mode, key and reverb type are chosen.
Notes are then played back at random intervals for an continously evolving ambient experience.

50% of the time it sounds terrible, but the other 50% is pretty poetic.
